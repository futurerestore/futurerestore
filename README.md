## Report an issue
You can do it [here](https://github.com/m1stadev/futurerestore/issues).

### Restoring on Windows 10
1.  Try to restore the device, error `-8` occurs;
2.  Leave the device plugged in, it'll stay on the Recovery screen;
3.  Head over to device manager under control panel in Windows;
4.  Locate "Apple Recovery (iBoot) USB Composite Device" (at the bottom);
5.  Right click and choose "Uninstall device".
    You may see a tick box that allows you to uninstall the driver software as well, tick that (all the three Apple mobile device entries under USB devices will disappear);
6.  Unplug the device and re-plug it in;
7.  Go back to futurerestore and send the restore command again (just press the up arrow to get it back, then enter).
    Error `-8` is now fixed, but the process will fail again after the screen of your device has turned green;
8.  Go back to device manager and repeat the driver uninstall process as described above (step 4 to 6);
9.  Go back to futurerestore once again and repeat the restore process;
10. The device will reboot and error `-10` will also be solved;
11. The restore will now proceed and succeed.

### Some about [cURL](https://github.com/curl/curl)
* Linux: Follow [this guide](https://dev.to/jake/using-libcurl3-and-libcurl4-on-ubuntu-1804-bionic-184g) to use tsschecker on Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic) as it requires libcurl3 which cannot coexist with libcurl4 on this OS.

## 0) What futurerestore can do
**Downgrade/Upgrade/Re-restore same mobile firmware version.**
Whenever you read "downgrade" nowadays it means you can also upgrade and re-restore if you're on the same firmware version. Basically this allows restoring an firmware version and the installed firmware version doesn't matter.

## 1) Prometheus (64-bit device) - generator method
### Requirements
- Jailbreak
- signing ticket files (`.shsh`, `.shsh2`, `.plist`) with a generator
- nonceEnabler patch enabled

### Info
You can downgrade, if the destination firmware version is compatible with the **latest signed SEP and baseband** and if you **have a signing tickets files with a generator for that firmware version**.

### How to use
1. Device must be jailbroken and nonceEnabler patch must be active
2. Open signing ticket file and look up the generator
  * Looks like this: `<key>generator</key><string>0xde3318d224cf14a1</string>`
3. Write the generator to device's NVRAM
  * Connect with SSH into the device and run `nvram com.apple.System.boot-nonce=0xde3318d224cf14a1` to set the generator *0xde3318d224cf14a1*
  * verify it with `nvram -p`
4. Connect your device in normal mode to computer
5. On the computer run `futurerestore -t ticket.shsh --latest-baseband --latest-sep ios.ipsw`

### Recommended methods to activate nonceEnabler patch
#### Method 1: ios-kern-utils (iOS 7.x-10.x)
1. Install DEB-file of [ios-kern-utils](https://github.com/Siguza/ios-kern-utils/releases/) on device;
2. Run on the device `nvpatch com.apple.System.boot-nonce`.

#### Method 2: Using special applications
Use utilities for setting boot-nonce generator:
1. [PhœnixNonce](https://github.com/Siguza/PhoenixNonce) for iOS 9.x;
2. [v0rtexnonce](https://github.com/arx8x/v0rtexnonce) for iOS 10.x;

## 2) Prometheus (64-bit device) - ApNonce collision method (Recovery mode)
### Requirements
- **Device with A7 chip on iOS 9.1 - 10.2 or iOS 10.3 beta 1**;
- Jailbreak doesn't required;
- Signing ticket files (`.shsh`, `.shsh2`, `.plist`) with a customly chosen ApNonce;
- Signing ticket files needs to have one of the ApNonces, which the device generates a lot;

### Info
You can downgrade if the destination firmware version, if it is compatible with the **latest signed SEP and baseband**. You also need to have **special signing ticket files**. If you don't know what this is, you probably can **NOT** use this method!

### How to use
1. Connect your device in normal or recovery mode;
2. On the computer run `futurerestore -w -t ticket.shsh --latest-baseband --latest-sep firmware.ipsw`
* If you have saved multiple signing tickets with different nonces you can specify more than
one to speed up the process: `futurerestore -w -t t1.shsh -t t2.shsh -t t3.shsh -t t4.shsh --latest-baseband --latest-sep firmware.ipsw`

---

## 3) Prometheus (64-bit device) - ApNonce collision method (DFU mode)
### Requirements
- __Devices with A7 (iPhone 5s, iPad Air, iPad mini 2), A8 (iPhone 6 [+], iPad mini [2,3,4], iPod touch [6th generation]) and A8X (iPad Air 2) chips on all firmwares;__
- __Devices have been released after ~September, 2015 {PROBABLY};__
- Jailbreak doesn't required;
- Signing ticket files (`.shsh`, `.shsh2`, `.plist`) with a customly chosen APNonce;
- Signing ticket files needs to have one of the ApNonces, which the device generates a lot;
- __[img4tool](https://github.com/tihmstar/img4tool) can't be used for Windows [problem with signing iBSS/iBEC], now it's TO-DO;__

### Info
You can downgrade if the destination firmware version, if it is compatible with the **latest signed SEP and baseband**. You also need to have **special signing ticket files**. If you don't know what this is, you probably can **NOT** use this method!

### How to use
1. Connect your device in DFU mode;
2. Use [irecovery](https://github.com/libimobiledevice/libirecovery) for checking ApNonce, which booted in DFU;
3. Extract iBSS/iBEC from target firmware for downgrade (unsigned);
4. Check DFU-collisioned ApNonces with [irecovery](https://github.com/libimobiledevice/libirecovery), which booted in DFU.
    You can't automatically collision DFU ApNonces.
    
    __If ApNonce is not collisioned, "use hands" for DFU booting.__
    
    __If ApNonce is successfully coliisioned, use this SHSH2 for sign iBSS/iBEC.__
5. Use img4tool for sign iBSS:
   `img4tool -s ticket.shsh -c iBSS.signed -p <original_iBSS>`;
6. Use img4tool for sign iBEC:
   `img4tool -s ticket.shsh -c iBEC.signed -p <original_iBEC>`;
7. So, after signing we can boot into Recovery with irecovery.

   `irecovery -f iBSS.signed` - loading iBSS;
   
   `irecovery -f iBEC.signed` - loading iBEC;
8. So good! On the computer run `futurerestore -t ticket.shsh --latest-baseband --latest-sep -w firmware.ipsw`.

## 4) Odysseus (32-bit / 64-bit devices)
### Requirements
- futurerestore compiled with libipatcher;
- Jailbreak or bootrom exploit (limera1n, checkm8);
- **32-bit**: firmware keys for the device/destination firmware version must be public (check ipsw.me);
- **64-bit**: devices with **A12** and **A13** chips is **NOT** compatible with this method;
- Signing ticket files (`.shsh`, `.shsh2`, `.plist`) from by destination firmware (OTA blobs work too!).

### Info
If you have a jailbroken device, you can downgrade to **any** firmware version you have blobs for. You can still get OTA blobs for iOS 6.1.3, 8.4.1 or 10.3.3 for some devices and use those.

### How to use
1. Get device into kDFU/pwnDFU
  * Pre-iPhone4s (limera1n devices):
    * Enter to pwnDFU mode with redsn0w or any other tool
  * iPhone 4s and later 32-bit devices:
    * Enter to kDFU mode with kDFU app (cydia: repo.tihmstar.net) or by loading a pwnediBSS from any existing odysseus bundle
  * Any 64-bit device:
    * Enter to pwnDFU mode and patch signature check with special fork of [ipwndfu](https://github.com/LinusHenze/ipwndfu_public)
2. Connect your device to computer in kDFU mode (or pwnDFU mode)
3. On the computer run `futurerestore --use-pwndfu -t ticket.shsh --latest-baseband firmware.ipsw`

You can use **any** odysseus bundle for this.

## 5) iOS 9.x re-restore bug by @alitek123 (only for 32-bit devices)
### Requirements
- Jailbreak doesn't required;
- Signing ticket files (`.shsh`, `.shsh2`, `.plist`) from by iOS 9.x without ApNonce (noNonce APTickets)

### Info
If you have **signing tickets files for iOS 9.x**, which **do not contain a ApNonce**, you can restore to that firmware.

### How to use
1. Connect your device in DFU mode
2. On the computer run `futurerestore -t ticket.shsh --latest-baseband ios9.ipsw`
