 The following properties control the minimum and maximum height of the accessory view. The minimum height is used when the menu bar is hidden, and the max height to a fully revealed menu bar. During the reveal, the accessory view's frame is interpolated between its minimum and maximum height.
 
 If the minimum height is zero (which it is by default), the accessory view is not resized; instead a special transition is used to reveal it with the menu bar. This simplifies the accessory view's task, because it does not have to handle the case of being set to zero height. To create a fixed-height accessory view, set the min and max height to be equal.
 
 By default, the min height is 0 and the max height gets set to the height of the accessory view's frame when it is set.
