 * StatusBarButtons are the visual representation of NSStatusItems, and are primarily displayed on the right side of the menu bar.
 * When a template image is set as the \c image property of the status bar button, it is rendered with the correct menu bar style. This guarantees that the button will look correct in various button states and appearances (such as dark menu bar).
