 All file promisesReceiver's in a drag must specify the same destination location.
 This is an array, because legacy promises are an array of files on one pasteboard item.
 The reader block is called on the supplied operationQueue when the promised file is ready to be read. When the source is an NSFilePromiseProvider, the readerBlock call is wrapped in an NSFileCoordination read. Otherwise, a heuristic is used to determine when the promised file is ready to be read.
 The options dictionary is ignored for now.
 Note: Writing of the promised file may be cancelled or fail. When either occurs, the readerBlock is still called, but with a non-nil NSError. When NSError is non-nil, fileURL should be ignored.
