 A normalized value for the input, between -1 and 1 for axis inputs. The values are deadzoned and saturated before they are returned
 so there is no value ouside the range. Deadzoning does not remove values from the range, the full 0 to 1 magnitude of values
 are possible from the input.

 As an axis is often used in a digital sense, you can rely on a value of 0 meaning the axis is inside the deadzone.
 Any value greater than or less than zero is not in the deadzone.
