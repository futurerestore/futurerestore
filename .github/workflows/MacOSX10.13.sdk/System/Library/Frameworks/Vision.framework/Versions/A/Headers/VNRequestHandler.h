 @header There are two types of request handlers: VNSequenceRequestHandler and VNImageRequestHandler.
 
 TODO:  re-document this
 
 Each of them are for scheduling @link VNRequest @/link. But the type of request dictates which kind of request handler to use. Some VNRequests can be used on multiple classes of VNTrackingHandlers while other require a specific one. Please refer to the documentation of the specific request. The general distinction between the 3 is that requests that are specific to an image (or buffer) would use the VNImageRequestHandler. Face detection is an example for the VNImageRequestHandler. For requests that span over multiple image buffers the request handler will hold on to past request data to allow algorithms to work on multiple buffers in a sequence and that sequence can be dynamic. 
 
 The base class VNSequenceRequestHandler is to be used for requests that are not tied to an image like Face Recognition that is based on already detected faces. Requests can be scheduled synchronous where the performRequests call waits for all requests to finish or asynchronous via performRequestsAsynchronous. performRequestsAsynchronous returns immediately. The client can monitor the completion of the requests through the completionHandler specified in each VNRequest.

 @brief VNImageOptionCameraIntrinsics  Specifies the camera intrinsics as an NSData or CFData representing a matrix_float3x3. See kCMSampleBufferAttachmentKey_CameraIntrinsicMatrix for details
 @discussion
     Camera intrinsic matrix is a CFData containing a matrix_float3x3, which is column-major. It has the following contents:
     fx	0	ox
     0	fy	oy
     0	0	1
     fx and fy are the focal length in pixels. For square pixels, they will have the same value.
     ox and oy are the coordinates of the principal point. The origin is the upper left of the frame.

 @brief Performs requests on a single image.
 @discussion The VNImageRequestHandler is created with an image that is used to be used for the requests a client might want to schedule. The VNImageRequestHandler retains, but never modifies, the image source for its entire lifetime. The client also must not modify the content of the image source once the VNImageRequestHandler is created otherwise the results are undefined.
             The VNImageRequestHandler can choose to also cache intermediate representation of the image or other request-specific information for the purposes of runtime performance.
