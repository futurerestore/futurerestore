				NOTE: Developers are strongly encouraged to override -(NSString *)description to return the name
				of the cocoa view. This name is displayed by host applications and should be returned as a copy
				instead of a static string.
				
				For example, you could define the description method like this:
					- (NSString *) description {
						return [NSString withString: @"Filter View"];

				This method is a factory function: each call to it must return a unique view.
				Each view must be returned with a retain count of 1 and autoreleased.
				It is the client's responsibility to retain the returned view and to release the view when it's no longer needed.
