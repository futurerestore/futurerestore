 * @discussion The CNContactStore is a thread safe class that can fetch and save contacts, fetch and save groups, and fetch containers.
 *
 * @note Some good practices are:
 * 1) Only fetch contact properties that will be used.
 * 2) When fetching all contacts and caching the results, first fetch all contact identifiers only. Then fetch batches of detailed contacts by identifiers as you need them.
 * 3) To aggregate several contact fetches collect a set of unique contact identifiers from the fetches. Then fetch batches of detailed contacts by identifiers.
 * 4) When CNContactStoreDidChangeNotification is posted, if you cache any fetched contacts/groups/containers then they must be refetched and the old cached objects released.

The user will only be prompted the first time access is requested; any subsequent CNContactStore calls will use the existing permissions. The completion handler is called on an arbitrary queue.
 *
 * @note Recommended to use CNContactStore instance methods in this completion handler instead of the UI main thread. This method is optional when CNContactStore is used on a background thread. If it is not used in that case, CNContactStore will block if the user is asked to grant or deny access.

 * @param entityType Set to CNEntityTypeContacts.
 * @param completionHandler This block is called upon completion. If the user grants access then granted is YES and error is nil. Otherwise granted is NO with an error.
