To specify an empty time range, pass NSNull for the track and a time range of starting at kCMTimeInvalid with a duration of the desired empty edit.

      If you insert an empty timeRange into the track, any media that was presented during that interval prior to the insertion will be presented instead immediately afterward.
      The exact meaning of the term "empty timeRange" depends upon the mediaType of the track. For example, an empty timeRange in a sound track presents silence.
