  @class		AVAsset

  @abstract
	An AVAsset is an abstract class that defines AVFoundation's model for timed audiovisual media.

	Each asset contains a collection of tracks that are intended to be presented or processed together, each of a uniform media type, including but not limited to audio, video, text, closed captions, and subtitles.

  @discussion
	AVAssets are often instantiated via its concrete subclass AVURLAsset with NSURLs that refer to audiovisual media resources, such as streams (including HTTP live streams), QuickTime movie files, MP3 files, and files of other types.

	They can also be instantiated using other concrete subclasses that extend the basic model for audiovisual media in useful ways, as AVComposition does for temporal editing.

	Properties of assets as a whole are defined by AVAsset. Additionally, references to instances of AVAssetTracks representing tracks of the collection can be obtained, so that each of these can be examined independently.
					
	Because of the nature of timed audiovisual media, upon successful initialization of an AVAsset some or all of the values for its keys may not be immediately available. The value of any key can be requested at any time, and AVAsset will always return its value synchronously, although it may have to block the calling thread in order to do so.

	In order to avoid blocking, clients can register their interest in particular keys and to become notified when their values become available. For further details, see AVAsynchronousKeyValueLoading.h.

	On iOS, it is particularly important to avoid blocking.  To preserve responsiveness, a synchronous request that blocks for too long (eg, a property request on an asset on a slow HTTP server) may lead to media services being reset.

	To play an instance of AVAsset, initialize an instance of AVPlayerItem with it, use the AVPlayerItem to set up its presentation state (such as whether only a limited timeRange of the asset should be played, etc.), and provide the AVPlayerItem to an AVPlayer according to whether the items is to be played by itself or together with a collection of other items. Full details available in AVPlayerItem.h and AVPlayer.h.
					
	AVAssets can also be inserted into AVMutableCompositions in order to assemble audiovisual constructs from one or more source assets.

	If nil is passed as the value of the options parameter to -[AVURLAsset initWithURL:options:], or if a dictionary that lacks a value for the key AVURLAssetPreferPreciseDurationAndTimingKey is passed instead, a default value of NO is assumed. If the asset is intended to be played only, because AVPlayer will support approximate random access by time when full precision isn't available, the default value of NO will suffice.
	Pass YES if longer loading times are acceptable in cases in which precise timing is required. If the asset is intended to be inserted into an AVMutableComposition, precise random access is typically desirable and the value of YES is recommended.
	Note that such precision may require additional parsing of the resource in advance of operations that make use of any portion of it, depending on the specifics of its container format. Many container formats provide sufficient summary information for precise timing and do not require additional parsing to prepare for it; QuickTime movie files and MPEG-4 files are examples of such formats. Other formats do not provide sufficient summary information, and precise random access for them is possible only after a preliminary examination of a file's contents.

	@abstract		A subclass of AVURLAsset that represents media resources that can be extended in total duration without modifying previously existing data structures.
	Such media resources include QuickTime movie files and MPEG-4 files that indicate, via an 'mvex' box in their 'moov' box, that they accommodate additional fragments. Media resources of other types may also be supported. To check whether a given instance of AVFragmentedAsset can be used to monitor the addition of fragments, check the value of the AVURLAsset property canContainFragments.
	An AVFragmentedAsset is capable of changing the values of certain of its properties and those of its tracks, while an operation that appends fragments to the underlying media resource in in progress, if the AVFragmentedAsset is associated with an instance of AVFragmentedAssetMinder.
	@discussion		While associated with an AVFragmentedAssetMinder, AVFragmentedAssetTrack posts AVAssetDurationDidChangeNotification and whenever new fragments are detected, as appropriate. It may also post AVAssetContainsFragmentsDidChangeNotification and AVAssetWasDefragmentedNotification, as discussed in documentation of those notifications.
