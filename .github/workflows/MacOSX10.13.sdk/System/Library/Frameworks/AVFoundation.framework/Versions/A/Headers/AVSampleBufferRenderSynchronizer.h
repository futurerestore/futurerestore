		Optional.  A block called when the renderer is removed from the synchronizer.  If provided, this block will always be called with didRemoveRenderer indicating whether the renderer was removed by this scheduled removal.
	@discussion
		This method can be called while rate is non-0.0.

		time is used to schedule future removals.  If the time is in the past, the renderer will be removed immediately.  kCMTimeInvalid can also be used to force immediate removal.
	
		This method removes the renderer asynchronously.  The method can be called more than once, with a subsequent scheduled removal replacing a previously scheduled removal.
					
		Clients may provide an optional completionHandler block to be notified when the scheduled removal completes.  If provided, completionHandler will always be called with the following values for didRemoveRenderer:
			
			- If the renderer has not been added to this synchronizer, completionHandler will be called and didRemoveRenderer will be NO.
			- If a removal of a particular renderer is scheduled after another removal of that same renderer has already been scheduled but not yet occurred, the previously-scheduled removal's completionHandler will be called and didRemoveRenderer will be NO.  The new scheduled removal's completionHandler will not be called until it is replaced by another scheduled removal or the renderer is actually removed.
			- When the renderer is removed due to a scheduled removal, the completionHandler provided when that removal was scheduled will be called and didRemoveRenderer will be YES.

		The serial queue onto which block should be enqueued.  If you pass NULL, the main queue (obtained using dispatch_get_main_queue()) will be used.  Passing a concurrent queue to this method will result in undefined behavior.

	@discussion
		The block is invoked periodically at the interval specified, interpreted according to the timeline of the timebase.  The block is also invoked whenever time jumps and whenever rendering starts or stops.
 
		If the interval corresponds to a very short interval in real time, the synchronizer may invoke the block less frequently than requested. Even so, the synchronizer will invoke the block sufficiently often for the client to update indications of the current time appropriately in its end-user interface.

		Upon return, the caller is guaranteed that no new time observer blocks will begin executing.  Depending on the calling thread and the queue used to add the time observer, an in-flight block may continue to execute after this method returns.  You can guarantee synchronous time observer removal by enqueuing the call to -removeTimeObserver: on that queue.  Alternatively, call dispatch_sync(queue, ^{}) after -removeTimeObserver: to wait for any in-flight blocks to finish executing.  -removeTimeObserver: should be used to explicitly cancel each time observer added using -addPeriodicTimeObserverForInterval:queue:usingBlock: and -addBoundaryTimeObserverForTimes:queue:usingBlock:.
