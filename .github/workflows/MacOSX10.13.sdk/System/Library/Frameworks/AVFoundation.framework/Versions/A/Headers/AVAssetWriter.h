	 AVAssetWriter provides services for writing media data to a new file,
 
 @discussion
	Instances of AVAssetWriter can write media to new files in formats such as the QuickTime movie file format or the MPEG-4 file format. AVAssetWriter has support for automatic interleaving of media data for multiple concurrent tracks. Source media data can be obtained from instances of AVAssetReader for one or more assets or from other sources outside of AVFoundation.

	Instances of AVAssetWriter can re-encode media samples as they are written. Instances of AVAssetWriter can also optionally write metadata collections to the output file.
 
	A single instance of AVAssetWriter can be used once to write to a single file. Clients that wish to write to files multiple times must use a new instance of AVAssetWriter each time.

	The starting asset time for the sample-writing session, in the timeline of the source samples.

 @discussion
	Sequences of sample data appended to the asset writer inputs are considered to fall within "sample-writing sessions", initiated with this method. Accordingly, this method must be called after writing has started (using -startWriting) but before any sample data is appended to the receiver's inputs.
	
	Each writing session has a start time which, where allowed by the file format being written, defines the mapping from the timeline of source samples to the timeline of the written file. In the case of the QuickTime movie file format, the first session begins at movie time 0, so a sample appended with timestamp T will be played at movie time (T-startTime).  Samples with timestamps earlier than startTime will still be added to the output file but will be edited out (i.e. not presented during playback). If the earliest appended sample for an input has a timestamp later than than startTime, an empty edit will be inserted to preserve synchronization between tracks of the output asset.
	
	To end the session started by use of this method, use -endSessionAtSourceTime: or -finishWritingWithCompletionHandler:.  It is an error to invoke -startSessionAtSourceTime: twice in a row without invoking -endSessionAtSourceTime: in between.

 @param endTime
	The ending asset time for the sample-writing session, in the timeline of the source samples.

 @discussion
	Call this method to complete a session started with -startSessionAtSourceTime:.
 
	The endTime defines the moment on the timeline of source samples at which the session ends. In the case of the QuickTime movie file format, each sample-writing session's startTime...endTime pair corresponds to a period of movie time into which the session's samples are inserted. Samples with timestamps that are later than the session end time will still be added to the written file but will be edited out (i.e. not presented during playback). So if the first session has duration D1 = endTime - startTime, it will be inserted into the written file at time 0 through D1; the second session would be inserted into the written file at time D1 through D1+D2, etc. It is legal to have a session with no samples; this will cause creation of an empty edit of the prescribed duration.
	
	It is not mandatory to call -endSessionAtSourceTime:; if -finishWritingWithCompletionHandler: is called without first invoking -endSessionAtSourceTime:, the session's effective end time will be the latest end timestamp of the session's appended samples (i.e. no samples will be edited out at the end).
 
	It is an error to append samples outside of a sample-writing session.  To append more samples after invoking -endSessionAtSourceTime:, you must first start a new session using -startSessionAtSourceTime:.

	This class is used to associate tracks corresponding to multiple AVAssetWriterInputs as mutually exclusive to each other for playback or other processing.
