    @abstract   Protocol that defines properties applicable to the input bus of a mixer
                node
    @discussion
        Nodes that conforms to the AVAudioMixing protocol can talk to a mixer node downstream,
        specifically of type AVAudioMixerNode or AVAudioEnvironmentNode. The properties defined 
        by this protocol apply to the respective input bus of the mixer node that the source node is 
        connected to. Note that effect nodes cannot talk to their downstream mixer.

		Properties can be set either on the source node, or directly on individual mixer connections.
		Source node properties are:
		- applied to all existing mixer connections when set
		- applied to new mixer connections
		- preserved upon disconnection from mixers
		- not affected by connections/disconnections to/from mixers
		- not affected by any direct changes to properties on individual mixer connections

		Individual mixer connection properties, when set, will override any values previously derived 
		from the corresponding source node properties. However, if a source node property is 
		subsequently set, it will override the corresponding property value of all individual mixer 
		connections.
		Unlike source node properties, individual mixer connection properties are not preserved upon
		disconnection (see `AVAudioMixing(destinationForMixer:bus:)` and `AVAudioMixingDestination`).

		Source nodes that are connected to a mixer downstream can be disconnected from
		one mixer and connected to another mixer with source node's mixing settings intact.
		For example, an AVAudioPlayerNode that is being used in a gaming scenario can set up its 
		3D mixing settings and then move from one environment to another.

	@discussion
		When a source node is connected to multiple mixers downstream, setting AVAudioMixing 
		properties directly on the source node will apply the change to all the mixers downstream. 
		If you want to set/get properties on a specific mixer, use this method to get the 
		corresponding AVAudioMixingDestination and set/get properties on it. 
 
		Note:
		- Properties set on individual AVAudioMixingDestination instances will not reflect at the
			source node level.

		- AVAudioMixingDestination reference returned by this method could become invalid when
			there is any disconnection between the source and the mixer node. Hence this reference
			should not be retained and should be fetched every time you want to set/get properties 
			on a specific mixer.
 
		If the source node is not connected to the specified mixer/input bus, this method
		returns nil.
		Calling this on an AVAudioMixingDestination instance returns self if the specified
		mixer/input bus match its connection point, otherwise returns nil.

    @discussion
        The rendering algorithms differ in terms of quality and cpu cost. 
        AVAudio3DMixingRenderingAlgorithmEqualPowerPanning is the simplest panning algorithm and also 
        the least expensive computationally.
 
        With the exception of AVAudio3DMixingRenderingAlgorithmSoundField, while the mixer is
        rendering to multi channel hardware, audio data will only be rendered to channels 1 & 2.
 
        AVAudio3DMixingRenderingAlgorithmEqualPowerPanning
            EqualPowerPanning merely pans the data of the mixer bus into a stereo field. This 
            algorithm is analogous to the pan knob found on a mixing board channel strip. 
 
        AVAudio3DMixingRenderingAlgorithmSphericalHead
            SphericalHead is designed to emulate 3 dimensional space in headphones by simulating 
            inter-aural time delays and other spatial cues. SphericalHead is slightly less CPU 
            intensive than the HRTF algorithm.
 
        AVAudio3DMixingRenderingAlgorithmHRTF
            HRTF (Head Related Transfer Function) is a high quality algorithm using filtering to 
            emulate 3 dimensional space in headphones. HRTF is a cpu intensive algorithm.
 
        AVAudio3DMixingRenderingAlgorithmHRTFHQ
            Higher quality HRTF rendering algorithm compared to AVAudio3DMixingRenderingAlgorithmHRTF.
            Improvements have been made to the overall frequency response and localization of
            sources in a 3D space.
 
        AVAudio3DMixingRenderingAlgorithmSoundField
            SoundField is designed for rendering to multi channel hardware. The mixer takes data 
            being rendered with SoundField and distributes it amongst all the output channels with 
            a weighting toward the location in which the sound derives. It is very effective for 
            ambient sounds, which may derive from a specific location in space, yet should be heard 
            through the listener's entire space.
 
        AVAudio3DMixingRenderingAlgorithmStereoPassThrough
            StereoPassThrough should be used when no localization is desired for the source data. 
            Setting this algorithm tells the mixer to take mono/stereo input and pass it directly to 
            channels 1 & 2 without localization.
