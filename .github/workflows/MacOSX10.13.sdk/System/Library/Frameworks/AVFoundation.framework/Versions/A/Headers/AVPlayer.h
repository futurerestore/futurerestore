	@class			AVPlayer
 
	@abstract
      AVPlayer offers a playback interface for single-item playback that's sufficient for
      the implementation of playback controllers and playback user interfaces.
 
	@discussion
      AVPlayer works equally well with local and remote media files, providing clients with appropriate
      information about readiness to play or about the need to await additional data before continuing.

      Visual content of items played by an instance of AVPlayer can be displayed in a CoreAnimation layer
      of class AVPlayerLayer.

	  To allow clients to add and remove their objects as key-value observers safely, AVPlayer serializes notifications of
	  changes that occur dynamically during playback on a dispatch queue. By default, this queue is the main queue. See dispatch_get_main_queue().
	  
	  To ensure safe access to AVPlayer's nonatomic properties while dynamic changes in playback state may be reported, clients must
	  serialize their access with the receiver's notification queue. In the common case, such serialization is naturally achieved
	  by invoking AVPlayer's various methods on the main thread or queue.

/*!
 @property		rate
 @abstract		Indicates the desired rate of playback; 0.0 means "paused", 1.0 indicates a desire to play at the natural rate of the current item.
 @discussion
 Setting the value of rate to 0.0 pauses playback, causing the value of timeControlStatus to change to AVPlayerTimeControlStatusPaused.
 Setting the rate to a non-zero value causes the value of timeControlStatus to become either AVPlayerTimeControlStatusWaitingToPlayAtSpecifiedRate or AVPlayerTimeControlStatusPlaying, depending on whether sufficient media data has been buffered for playback to occur and whether the player's default behavior of waiting in order to minimize stalling is permitted. See discussion of AVPlayerTimeControlStatus for more details.
 
 AVPlayer can reset the desired rate to 0.0 when a change in overall state requires playback to be halted, such as when an interruption occurs on iOS, as announced by AVAudioSession, or when the playback buffer becomes empty and playback stalls while automaticallyWaitsToMinimizeStalling is NO.

 The effective rate of playback may differ from the desired rate even while timeControlStatus is AVPlayerTimeControlStatusPlaying, if the processing algorithm in use for managing audio pitch requires quantization of playback rate. For information about quantization of rates for audio processing, see AVAudioProcessingSettings.h. You can always obtain the effective rate of playback from the currentItem's timebase; see the timebase property of AVPlayerItem.

@interface AVPlayer (AVPlayerAdvancedRateControl)


/*!
 @property		automaticallyWaitsToMinimizeStalling
 @abstract		Indicates that the player is allowed to delay playback at the specified rate in order to minimize stalling
 @discussion
 
 When this property is YES, whenever 1) the rate is set from zero to non-zero or 2) the playback buffer becomes empty and playback stalls, the player will attempt to determine if, at the specified rate, its currentItem will play to the end without interruptions. Should it determine that such interruptions would occur and these interruptions can be avoided by delaying the start or resumption of playback, the value of timeControlStatus will become AVPlayerTimeControlStatusWaitingToPlayAtSpecifiedRate and playback will start automatically when the likelihood of stalling has been minimized.
 
 You may want to set this property to NO when you need precise control over playback start times, e.g., when synchronizing multiple instances of AVPlayer, and you should set it to NO if you use an AVAssetResourceLoader delegate to load media data (more on this below). If the value of this property is NO, reasonForWaitingToPlay cannot assume a value of AVPlayerWaitingToMinimizeStallsReason.
 This implies that setting rate to a non-zero value in AVPlayerTimeControlStatusPaused will cause playback to start immediately as long as the playback buffer is not empty. When the playback buffer becomes empty during AVPlayerTimeControlStatusPlaying and playback stalls, playback state will switch to AVPlayerTimeControlStatusPaused and the rate will become 0.0.
 
 Changing the value of this property to NO while the value of timeControlStatus is AVPlayerTimeControlStatusWaitingToPlayAtSpecifiedRate with a reasonForWaitingToPlay of AVPlayerWaitingToMinimizeStallsReason will cause the player to attempt playback at the specified rate immediately.
 
 For clients linked against iOS 10.0 and running on that version or later or linked against OS X 10.12 and running on that version or later, the default value of this property is YES.
 In versions of iOS prior to iOS 10.0 and versions of OS X prior to 10.12, this property is unavailable, and the behavior of the AVPlayer corresponds to the type of content being played. For streaming content, including HTTP Live Streaming, the AVPlayer acts as if automaticallyWaitsToMinimizeStalling is YES. For file-based content, including file-based content accessed via progressive http download, the AVPlayer acts as if automaticallyWaitsToMinimizeStalling is NO.

 If you employ an AVAssetResourceLoader delegate that loads media data for playback, you should set the value of your AVPlayer’s automaticallyWaitsToMinimizeStalling property to NO. Allowing the value of automaticallyWaitsToMinimizeStalling to remain YES when an AVAssetResourceLoader delegate is used for the loading of media data can result in poor start-up times for playback and poor recovery from stalls, because the behaviors provided by AVPlayer when automaticallyWaitsToMinimizeStalling has a value of YES depend on predictions of the future availability of media data that that do not function as expected when data is loaded via a client-controlled means, using the AVAssetResourceLoader delegate interface.

 You can allow the value of automaticallyWaitsToMinimizeStalling to remain YES if you use an AVAssetResourceLoader delegate to manage content keys for FairPlay Streaming, to provide dynamically-generated master playlists for HTTP Live Streaming, or to respond to authentication challenges, but not to load media data for playback.

	"External playback" is a mode where video data is sent to an external device for full screen playback at its original fidelity.
	AirPlay Video playback is considered as an "external playback" mode.
 
	In "external screen" mode (also known as mirroring and second display), video data is rendered on the host 
	device (e.g. Mac and iPhone), rendered video is recompressed and transferred to the external device, and the
	external device decompresses and displays the video.
 
	AVPlayerExternalPlaybackSupport properties affect AirPlay Video playback and are the replacement for the 
	deprecated AVPlayerAirPlaySupport properties.
