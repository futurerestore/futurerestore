    @abstract		AVAssetImageGenerator provides thumbnail or preview images of assets independently of playback.
	
	@discussion		Generating a single image in isolation can require the decoding of a large number of video frames
					with complex interdependencies. Whenever a series of images is required, far greater efficiency
					can be achieved by use of the asynchronous method, -generateCGImagesAsynchronouslyForTimes:completionHandler:,
					which employs decoding efficiencies similar to those used during playback.
