 - QCPatchController is a simple controller to use with Cocoa bindings that wraps a QCComposition
 - The controller can be bound to a QCView in which case the composition bound to "patch" will be rendered into it.
 - UI elements may be bound to the controller using the keys of published input/output ports to control the parameters of the composition.
