/*! @class      MPSNNGraph
 *  @abstract   Optimized representation of a graph of MPSNNImageNodes and MPSNNFilterNodes
 *  @discussion Once you have prepared a graph of MPSNNImageNodes and MPSNNFilterNodes
 *              (and if needed MPSNNStateNodes), you may initialize a MPSNNGraph using 
 *              the MPSNNImageNode that you wish to appear as the result. The MPSNNGraph 
 *              object will introspect the graph representation and determine which nodes
 *              are needed for inputs, and which nodes are produced as output state (if any).
 *              Nodes which are not needed to calculate the result image node are ignored.
 *              Some nodes may be internally concatenated with other nodes for better 
 *              performance.
 *
 *              Note: the MPSNNImageNode that you choose as the result node may be interior
 *                    to a graph. This feature is provided as a means to examine intermediate
 *                    computations in the full graph for debugging purposes.
 *
 *              During MPSNNGraph construction, the graph attached to the result node will 
 *              be parsed and reduced to an optimized representation. This representation may
 *              be saved using the NSSecureCoding protocol for later recall.
 *                  
 *              When decoding a MPSNNGraph using a NSCoder, it will be created against 
 *              the system default MTLDevice. If you would like to set the MTLDevice,
 *              your NSCoder should conform to the <MPSDeviceProvider> protocol.
 *
 *              You may find it helpful to set MPSKernelOptionsVerbose on the graph when
 *              debugging.

 *
 *  @discussion     IMPORTANT:  Please use [MTLCommandBuffer addCompletedHandler:] to determine when this work is
 *                  done. Use CPU time that would have been spent waiting for the GPU to encode the next command
 *                  buffer and commit it too.  That way, the work for the next command buffer is ready to go the
 *                  moment the GPU is done. This will keep the GPU busy and running at top speed.
 *
 *                  Those who ignore this advice and use [MTLCommandBuffer waitUntilCompleted] instead will likely
 *                  cause their code to slow down by a factor of two or more. The CPU clock spins down while it
 *                  waits for the GPU. When the GPU completes, the CPU runs slowly for a while until it spins up.
 *                  The GPU has to wait for the CPU to  encode more work (at low clock), giving it plenty of time to
 *                  spin its own clock down. In typical CNN graph usage, neither may ever reach maximum clock
 *                  frequency, causing slow down far beyond what otherwise would be expected from simple failure
 *                  to schedule CPU and GPU work concurrently. Regrattably, it is probable that every performance

/*! @abstract Convenience method to execute a graph without having to manage many Metal details
 *  @discussion   This function will synchronously encode the graph on a private command buffer,
 *                commit it to a MPS internal command queue and return. The GPU will start working.
 *                When the GPU is done, the completion handler will be called.  You should use
 *                the intervening time to encode other work for execution on the GPU, so that
 *                the GPU stays busy and doesn't clock down.
 *
 *                The work will be performed on the MTLDevice that hosts the source images.
 *
 *                This is a convenience API.  There are a few situations it does not handle optimally.
 *                These may be better handled using [encodeToCommandBuffer:sourceImages:].
 *                Specifically:
 *                @code
 *                    o     If the graph needs to be run multiple times for different images,
 *                          it would be better to encode the graph multiple times on the same
 *                          command buffer using [encodeToCommandBuffer:sourceImages:]  This
 *                          will allow the multiple graphs to share memory for intermediate
 *                          storage, dramatically reducing memory usage.
 *
 *                    o     If preprocessing or post-processing of the MPSImage is required,
 *                          such as resizing or normalization outside of a convolution, it would
 *                          be better to encode those things on the same command buffer.
 *                          Memory may be saved here too for intermediate storage. (MPSTemporaryImage
 *                          lifetime does not span multiple command buffers.)

 *                          MPSNNGraph.sourceImageHandles. They should be allocated against
 *                          the same MTLDevice. There must be at least one source image.
 *                          Note: this array is intended to handle the case where multiple
 *                          input images are required to generate a single graph result.
 *                          That is, the graph itself has multiple inputs.  If you need to

 *                          times, or better yet use [encodeToCommandBuffer:sourceImages:]
