.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX "native to ASCII converter" "" "native to ASCII converter \(em \fLnative2ascii\fP"
.IX "native2ascii" "" "\fLnative2ascii\fP \(em native to ASCII converter"
The Java 
compiler and other Java tools can only process files
that contain Latin-1 or Unicode-encoded (\\udddd notation)
characters.
.B native2ascii 
converts files that contain other
character encoding into files containing Latin-1 or
Unicode-encoded charaters.
.LP
If
.I outputfile 
is omitted, standard output is used for output.
In addition, if
.I inputfile 
is omitted, standard input is used for input.
.SH OPTIONS
The following options are supported:
.TP 5
.B \-encoding \f2encoding_name\f1
Specifies the encoding name that is used by the conversion
procedure.
The default encoding is taken from system property
.BR file.encoding .
The
.I encoding_name 
string must be one 
taken from the first column of the table of supported
encodings in the Supported Encodings document:

http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5/docs/guide/intl/encoding.doc.html
.TP 5
.B \-reverse
Performs the reverse operation: converts a file with Latin-1
or Unicode-encoded characters to one with native-encoded
characters.
.TP 15
.BI \-J option
Pass
.I option
to the Java virtual machine, where 
.I option
is one of the options described on the man page for the
java application launcher, java(1). For example,
.B \-J-Xms48m
sets the startup memory to 48 megabytes. It is a common convention for
.B \-J
to pass options to the underlying virtual machine.
