.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rmiregistry 
[
.I port
] 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX "Java remote object registry" "" "Java remote object registry \(em \fLrmiregistry\fP"
.IX "rmiregistry" "" "\fLrmiregistry\fP \(em Java remote object registry"
The 
.B rmiregistry 
command creates and starts a remote object
registry on the specified port on the current host. 
If port number
is omitted, the registry is started on port 1099. 
The 
.B rmiregistry
command produces no output and is typically run in the background.
For example:
.LP
.RS
.B example% rmiregistry &
.RE
.LP
A remote object registry is a bootstrap naming service that is
used by
.SM RMI
servers on a host to bind remote objects to names.
Clients can then look up remote objects and make remote method
invocations.
.LP
The registry is typically used to locate the first remote object
on which an application needs to invoke methods.
That object in
turn provides application-specific support for finding other
objects.
.LP
The methods of the 
.B java.rmi.registry.LocateRegistry 
class are used
to get a registry operating on a particular host or host and port.
.LP
The
.SM URL\s0-based
methods of the 
.B java.rmi.Naming 
class operate on a
registry and can be used to look up a remote object, bind a simple
(string) name to a remote object, rebind a new name to a remote
object (overriding the old binding), unbind a remote object, and
list the
.SM URL\s0s
bound in the registry.
