.SH SYNOPSIS
.B jstat
[
.I generalOption 
| 
.I outputOptions vmid 
[
.I interval
[ s|ms ] [
.I count
] ] ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B jstat
tool displays performance statistics for an instrumented 
HotSpot Java virtual machine (JVM). The target JVM is identified by
its virtual machine identifier, or vmid option described below. 
.LP
.B NOTE -
This utility is unsupported and may or may not be 
available in future versions of the J2SE SDK. 
It is currently not available on Windows 98 and Windows ME platforms.
.SS VIRTUAL MACHINE IDENTIFIER
The syntax of the vmid string largely corresponds to the syntax of a URI: 
.LP
.RS
.ft 3
.nf
[protocol:][//]lvmid[@hostname][:port][/servername]
.fi
.ft 1
.RE
.if t .TP 20
.if n .TP 15
.B protocol
The communications protocol. If the protocol is omitted and a hostname is not specified, the default protocol is a platform specific optimized
local protocol. If the protocol is omitted and a hostname is specified, then the default protocol is rmi. 
.if t .TP 20
.if n .TP 15
.B lvmid
The local virtual machine identifier for the target JVM. The lvmid is a platform-specific value that uniquely identifies a JVM on a system. The
lvmid is the only required component of a virtual machine identifier. The lvmid is typically, but not necessarily, the operating system's process
identifier for the target JVM process. You can use the jps command to determine the lvmid. Also, you can determine lvmid on Unix platforms
with the ps command, and on Windows with the Windows Task Manager. 
.if t .TP 20
.if n .TP 15
.B hostname
A hostname or IP address indicating the target host. If hostname is omitted, then the target host is the local host. 
.if t .TP 20
.if n .TP 15
.B port
The default port for communicating with the remote server. If the hostname is omitted or the protocol specifies an optimized, local protocol,
then port is ignored. Otherwise, treatment of the port parameter is implementation specific. For the default rmi protocol, the port indicates the
port number for the rmiregistry on the remote host. If port is omitted, and protocol indicates rmi, then the default rmiregistry port (1099) is
used. 
.if t .TP 20
.if n .TP 15
.B servername
The treatment of this parameter depends on implementation. For the optimized local protocol, this field is ignored. For the rmi protocol, it
represents the name of the RMI remote object on the remote host. 
.SH PARAMETERS 
.if t .TP 20
.if n .TP 15
.BI generalOption
A single general command-line option (\f3\-help\fP, \f3\-options\fP, or \f3\-version\fP)
.if t .TP 20
.if n .TP 15
.BI outputOptions
One or more output options, consisting of a single statOption, 
plus any of the \f3\-t\fP, \f3\-h\fP, and \f3\-J\fP options. 
.if t .TP 20
.if n .TP 15
.BI vmid
Virtual machine identifier, a string indicating the target Java virtual machine (JVM). The general syntax is 
.LP
.RS
.ft 3
.nf
[protocol:][//]lvmid[@hostname[:port]/servername
.fi
.ft 1
.RE
.LP
The syntax of the vmid string largely corresponds to the syntax of a URI. The vmid can vary from a simple integer representing a local JVM to a
more complex construction specifying a communications protocol, port number, and other implementation-specific values. See Virtual Machine
Identifier below for details. 
.if t .TP 20
.if n .TP 15
.BI interval[s|ms]
Sampling interval in the specified units, seconds (s) or milliseconds (ms). Default units are milliseconds.  Must be a positive integer.  If specified,
jstat will produce its output at each interval. 
.if t .TP 20
.if n .TP 15
.BI count
Number of samples to display. Default value is infinity; that is, jstat displays statistics until the target JVM terminates or the jstat command is
terminated.  Must be a positive integer. 
.SH OPTIONS
The
.B jstat
command supports two types of options, general options and output options. 
General options cause jstat to display simple
usage and version information. Output options determine the 
content and format of the statistical output. 
.LP
.B NOTE-
All options, and their functionality are subject to change or removal in future releases.
.SS GENERAL OPTIONS
If you specify one of the general options, you cannot specify any other option or parameter. 
.if t .TP 20
.if n .TP 15
.BI \-help
Display help message.
.if t .TP 20
.if n .TP 15
.BI \-version
Display version information.
.if t .TP 20
.if n .TP 15
.BI \-options
Display list of statistics options. See the Output Options section below.
.SS OUTPUT OPTIONS
If you do not specify a general option, then you can specify output options. 
Output options determine the content and format of jstat's
output, and consist of a single statOption, plus any of the other output 
options (\f3\-h\fP, \f3\-t\fP, and \f3\-J\fP).  The statOption must come first. 
.LP
Output is formatted as a table, with columns are separated by spaces. 
A header row with titles describes the columns.  Use the 
.B \-h
option to set the frequency at which the header is displayed.  
Column header names are generally consistent between the different
options. In general, if two options provide a column with the same 
name, then the data source for the two columns are the same. 
.LP
Use the 
.B \-t 
option to display a time stamp column, labeled Timestamp 
as the first column of output. The Timestamp column contains the
elapsed time, in seconds, since startup of the target JVM. The resolution 
of the time stamp is dependent on various factors and is subject
to variation due to delayed thread scheduling on heavily loaded systems. 
.LP
Use the interval and count parameters to determine how frequently and how 
many times, respectively, \f3jstat\fP displays its output.
.LP
.B NOTE-
You are advised not to write scripts to parse jstat's output since 
the format may change in future releases. If you choose to write
scripts that parse jstat output, expect to modify them for future 
releases of this tool. 
.if t .TP 20
.if n .TP 15
.BI \-statOption
Determines the statistics information that jstat displays. The following 
table lists the available options.  Use the \f3\-options\fP general option to
display the list of options for a particular platform installation.

.SH EXAMPLES
This section presents some examples of monitoring a local JVM 
with a lvmid of 21891. 
.SS Using the gcutil option
This example attaches to lvmid 21891 and takes 7 samples at 250 
millisecond intervals and displays the output as specified by the
\-gcutil option.

The output of this example shows that a young generation collection 
occurred between the 3rd and 4th sample. The collection took
0.001 seconds and promoted objects from the eden space (E) to the 
old space (O), resulting in an increase of old space utilization from
9.49% to 9.51%. Before the collection, the survivor space was 
12.44% utilized, but after this collection it is only 7.74% utilized. 
.SS Repeating the column header string
This example attaches to lvmid 21891 and takes samples at 250 
millisecond intervals and displays the output as specified by \-gcutil
option. In addition, it uses the \f3\-h3\fP option to output the column 
header after every 3 lines of data.

In addition to showing the repeating header string, this example 
shows that between the 2nd and 3rd samples, a young GC occurred. Its
duration was 0.001 seconds. The collection found enough live data that 
the survivor space 0 utilization (S0U) would would have
exceeded the desired survivor Size (DSS). As a result, objects were 
promoted to the old generation (not visible in this output), and the
tenuring threshold (TT) was lowered from 31 to 2. 
.LP
Another collection occurs between the 5th and 6th samples. This 
collection found very few survivors and returned the tenuring
threshold to 31. 
.SS Including a time stamp for each sample
This example attaches to lvmid 21891 and takes 3 samples at 
250 millisecond intervals. The \f3\-t\fP option is used to generate a time stamp
for each sample in the first column.

.SS Monitor instrumentation for a remote JVM 
This example attaches to lvmid 40496 on the system named remote.domain 
using the \f3\-gcutil\fP option, with samples taken every second
indefinitely. 
.LP

.nf
jstat -gcutil 40496@remote.domain 1000

.ft 1
.LP
The lvmid is combined with the name of the remote host to construct a vmid 
of 40496@remote.domain. This vmid results in the use of
the rmi protocol to communicate to the default jstatd server on 
the remote host. The jstatd server is located using the rmiregistry on
remote.domain that is bound to the default rmiregistry port (port 1099).
