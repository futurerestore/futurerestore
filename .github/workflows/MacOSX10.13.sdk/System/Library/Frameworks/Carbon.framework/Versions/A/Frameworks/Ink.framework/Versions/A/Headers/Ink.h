   Ink-related events are defined in CarbonEvents.h.  The
   following discussion gives some insight into when and how
   they are best used.
*/

/*
   When the pen is first pressed to the tablet, before inking
   has started, the Ink Manager must determine whether this
   pen-down should be treated as an inking or a mousing action. 
   If the pen-down occurs over certain user interface elements,
   that the user might reasonably expect to respond to immediate
   mouse input (such as the menubar, the Dock, a window’s
   titlebar, scrollbar, or controls in general), the Ink Manager
   will treat the pen as a mouse, and will not produce ink. This
   is known as “instant mousing”, and the user interface
   elements that force instant mousing are known as “instant
   mousers”.  When it is determined that the pen down did NOT
   occur over an instant mouser, the decision about whether to
   ink or mouse is still deferred briefly, and events are queued
   internally, until this decision can be made based on what the
   user does with the pen.  If the user moves the pen a
   sufficient distance, in a short enough time, then she is
   assumed to be writing, and all of the points in the internal
   queue, plus this point, will be treated as ink.  On the other
   hand, if the user holds the pen sufficiently still for a
   sufficient length of time, then it is assumed she wishes to
   use the pen as a mouse, so queued events are reposted and
   they, plus the current event, go unhandled by the Ink
   Manager, thus propagating to the application, where they will
   be handled as ordinary mouse events.
   In order to provide a consistent user experience with ink,
   and to avoid requiring applications to implement this complex
   bit of code themselves, while still allowing apps to:
     - do their own inking
     - handle special controls even while the Ink Manager is inking
     - define their own instant mousers
     - terminate phrases when app-specific conditions are met, such
       as the pen exiting a particular region of the window/screen
   all while letting the Ink Manager do the bulk of the work
   accumulating points into strokes, strokes into phrases,
   performing recognition, and posting high-level Ink
   events, the Ink Manager generates two special Carbon
   events to allow applications to manage the flow of pen events.
   The first of these, kEventApplicationIsEventInInstantMouser, 
   is dispatched only when a pen is initially pressed to a tablet,
   at the beginning of a phrase, before it has been determined
   whether the user is writing or not.  Once the user has begun
   writing, pen-downs will not generate these instant-mouser events.
   How the application responds to this event determines whether
   the Ink Manager is allowed to treat the pen-down as ink or not.
   Cocoa applications can implement the NSResponder method
   -shouldBeTreatedAsInkEvent for these purposes.
   This event allows clients to determine whether the current
   pen-down (mouseDown) event is over an application-defined
   instant mousing region. Application desiring to implement
   their own instant mousing controls or regions will need to
   register install a handler for this event.  This test will be
   performed early in the Ink Manager’s logic that determines
   whether an event should be treated as mouse or ink.  It only
   applies to new pen-downs (before inking has started).
   The second of these, kEventInkPoint, allows clients to
   see and potentially handle all pen events that the Ink
   Manager has determined correspond to inking (as opposed to
   mousing).  Here also the app installs an event handler. 
   These events, however, are dispatched only after the Ink Manager has
   decided the event corresponds to ink (user writing).  If the
   application handles the event (returns noErr), then the Ink
   Manager does nothing further with the event. If the
   application’s function returns any other value (including
   eventNotHandledErr), the point will be processed normally by
   the Ink Manager.  I.e., the point will be added to a stroke
   (old or new, depending on pen up/down state).  Note that this
   means the app will only see mouseDown and mouseDragged events
   in this handler, and they will always have tablet
   data in them.  This permits apps to:
     - draw their own ink, but only when the user would expect ink
     - prevent inking over special controls (e.g., a “Finished
       Writing” button an app might provide for a user to indicate
       she is done entering data into the current window or field)
     - terminate the current phrase (e.g., in response to that
       “Finished Writing” button)
   Applications that want to draw their own ink, while letting
   the Ink Manager deal with data accumulation and recognition,
   will want to install a handler for this event.  (To take over
   complete control of event handling, data accumulation, and
   recognition, apps can disable the Ink Manager’s processing of
   pen events entirely, by calling
   InkSetApplicationWritingMode(kInkWriteNowhereInApp) and
   handling pen events themselves.)
   If the handler returns noErr, indicating the app has chosen
   to handle this event and inhibiting further Ink Manager
   processing of the event, the event will go unhandled by the
   Ink Manager.  This results in the original mouse event being
   dispatched to the app through the normal Carbon Event Manager
   chain.  So apps should only make the decision that this event
   is one they wish to handle (or not), never carry out any of
   the actions the app might associate with the event in the
   handler (aside from inking, if the app is drawing the ink
   instead of relying on the Ink Manager to draw the ink).  The
   app should also do minimal processing in this handler because
   these events are generated at a rapid rate while the user is
   actively inking, and it is important not to introduce a lag
   in the inking process.  If the handler returns
   eventNotHandledErr, indicating the app has chosen NOT to
   handle this event, thus allowing the Ink Manager to process
   it normally, the Ink Manager will handle the event, and the
   app will not see this particular event again.
   When the Ink Manager is allowed to handle ink-point events
   and accumulate them into strokes and phrases internally,
   or when an application sends whole strokes’ worth of data
   (that it has accumulated) at a time to the Ink Manager, and
   the current phrase is terminated (either by the user or the
   application), two types of high-level ink events may be
   generated.
   The first of these high-level ink events is the
   kEventInkGesture event. This ink-gesture event is
   only sent when the Ink Manager has recognized the ink as one
   of the known system gestures (defined below).  Ink-aware
   applications can install a handler for these events, to
   provide targeted gestures and support for context-dependent
   (tentative) gestures, as discussed below.
   The second of these high-level ink events is the
   kEventInkText event. This ink-text event is sent
   when the Ink Manager has recognized the ink as text.  In
   Roman languages the ink-text event corresponds to an
   individual word.  It contains the original ink and the
   recognized text, typically including a number of alternate
   recognition hypotheses that ink-aware applications can offer
   to the user to enhance the ink/recognition experience.

/*
 *  InkGestureKind
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    The following constants are the values returned for the
 *    kEventParameterInkGestureKind parameter of
 *    kEventApplicationInkGesture events, and define the complete set
 *    of system gestures which a user may invoke by drawing them.  In
 *    general, when an InkGesture event is received by an application,
 *    the app will determine the gesture kind and then take appropriate
 *    action.  The meanings and implied actions of most of these
 *    gestures are obvious (undo, cut, copy, paste, etc.), though a few
 *    clarifications follow that may be useful. 
 *    
 *    See the Ink prefPane, Gestures tab, for pictures of these
 *    gestures, and animations that show how they are drawn. 
 *    
 *    Some gestures have a defined “hotspot” that can be used to
 *    determine what the gesture should be applied to.  Used in this
 *    fashion, the gesture is called a “targeted” gesture. Because the
 *    “target” is only knowable by the application, all gestures used
 *    in non-ink-aware apps are treated as “untargeted”.  Untargeted
 *    gestures apply to the current selection or insertion point. 
 *    Targeted gestures can apply to the item under the hotspot or even
 *    the entire gesture bounds. 
 *    
 *    For example, consider the paste gesture.  If being treated as an
 *    untargeted gesture, any pasted data would flow to the current
 *    insertion point.  If, however, it was being treated as a targeted
 *    gesture, any pasted data would be inserted at the location of the
 *    gesture’s hotspot. 
 *    
 *    If the gesture doesn’t have a hotspot or that hotspot lies
 *    outside the application’s windows, the gesture should usually be
 *    treated as an untargeted gesture.  An exception is the Clear
 *    gesture, which doesn’t have a hotspot, but might be targeted to
 *    all of the text it overlaps (to a sufficient degree--say, more
 *    than 50% of each word’s onscreen area, on a word by word basis).
 *    
 *    
 *    The InkPad demonstrates the use of targeted gestures, while any
 *    non-ink-aware app demonstrates the use of untargeted gestures.
 *    
 *    
 *    If a gesture does not have a hotspot, the
 *    kEventApplicationInkGesture event will not have a
 *    kEventParamInkGestureHotspot parameter. 
 *    
 *    There are also two classes of ink gesture, identified solely by
 *    the gesture type, that require and produce different handling. 
 *    The two classes are: 
 *    
 *    Non-tentative -- Non-tentative gestures are always and only
 *    treated as gestures, regardless of where they are drawn.  They
 *    are non-tentative because they may be applied anywhere and
 *    because they have been designed to not conflict with normal
 *    alphanumeric characters. If an application fails to handle them
 *    (has no handler installed or returns eventNotHandledErr), the Ink
 *    Manager will convert them to keyDowns (typically as command-key
 *    shortcuts).  No attempt will be made to recognize and post them
 *    as text. 
 *    
 *    Tentative -- Tentative gestures should only be interpreted as
 *    gestures if it makes sense, given the context (knowable only by
 *    your application).  If an application fails to handle a tentative
 *    gesture (has no handler installed or returns eventNotHandledErr),
 *    the Ink Manager will recognize and post the corresponding ink as
 *    text. 
 *    
 *    For example, if the join gesture is received, but the top-left
 *    and top-right points of the bounding box are not near the end and
 *    beginning of two words, respectively, with a space between them,
 *    then nothing should be done, and the event containing the gesture
 *    should not be handled (return eventNotHandledErr). The event will
 *    then be recognized and posted as text, probably as an uppercase
 *    or lowercase ‘v’. (On the other hand, if the gesture is in a
 *    reasonable location relative to appropriate text, then the two
 *    affected words would be joined, and the event handler would
 *    return noErr.)  By contrast, if the undo gesture went unhandled
 *    by an application, the Ink Manager would cause a sequence of key
 *    events to be posted that simulated the user typing a command-u.

   Once an ink phrase has been started, it will normally
   continue until either the user removes the pen from the
   tablet’s proximity or waits a user settable period of time
   while not pressing the pen to the tablet.  Once one of these
   things happens the ink phrase will be terminated and the Ink
   Manager will erase all of the ink associated with the session
   (if any was drawn). Ink phrases may also be terminated by the
   recognizer, if the user writes sufficiently far away from the
   previous ink—either horizontally, or on a new line. If the
   client needs control over when ink phrases are terminated,
   the following API can be used to determine exactly which
   conditions are permitted to terminate phrases.
   If, for example, a client wants to force all ink drawn in a
   particular input window to be treated as a single phrase,
   until a special “Finished Writing” button is pressed,
   calling this API with an argument of zero will turn off all
   automatic phrase termination, and installing a handler for
   kEventWindowInkPoint will allow the application to see pen
   events before the Ink Manager consumes them, and thus handle
   the button tap and call InkTerminateCurrentPhrase() at the
   appropriate time.
   Clients should be sure to manage phrase termination
   reasonably themselves, if they use this API to disable
   automatic phrase termination.

   Alternate text hypotheses lists (alternate word lists in

   API allows clients to insert the alternate hypotheses list
   for a given InkTextRef into an existing menu.  The Ink
   Manager will attach certain menu event handlers to this menu,
   so clients should use this MenuRef directly, rather than copy
   items out of it to another menu.
   The selection of a menu item in the alternates menu will
   result in a reordering of the InkTextRef’s alternates
   list, so that the selected item becomes the first item in the
   list. This makes the user’s choice persistent in internal
   system data structures without requiring the client to call
   any additional APIs.
   Upon return from ContextualMenuSelect(), the client can tell
   if the user has made a selection by checking the value of
   outUserSelectionType, as usual.  If a selection has been
   made, the client can examine the outMenuID and outMenuItem
   parameters of ContextualMenuSelect(), and use them to obtain
   the alternate text with CopyMenuItemTextAsCFString().
   Alternatively, the new selection will be the top-choice (at
   index zero) alternate, available using
   InkTextCreateCFString().  The app should replace the
   original text (corresponding to the original event location)
   with the alternate text obtained from either the menu or the
   reordered InkTextRef.
   Note:  After a user selection from this menu, and the
   resultant reordering of the InkTextRef’s alternates list, the
   original text will still be among the alternates.  However,
   it may be in either the second or the third alternate
   position, depending upon the particular text.  In Roman
   languages, if the first letter is alphabetic, an
   alternate-first-letter-case hypothesis will be in the second
   position and the original text will be in the third position.
   For a non-alphabetic first character, however, such as a
   number, the original will be in the second position.  (The
   client should know the identity of the original text from its
   own internal data structures and the location of the event
   that triggered the contextual/alternates menu.)

 *    and clipping constraints. Pass in NULL for iContext if you want
 *    to draw to the canonical context of the current port.
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    iTextRef:
 *      The InkTextRef you wish to draw.
 *    
 *    iContext:
 *      The CGContext to draw into, or NULL if you want to use the
