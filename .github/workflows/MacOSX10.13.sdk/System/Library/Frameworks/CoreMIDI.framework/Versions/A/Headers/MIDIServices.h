/*!
	@header MIDIServices.h

	This is the header file for Mac OS X's MIDI system services.

<h2>API Overview</h2>
	Drivers own and control Devices, e.g. USB interfaces, PCI cards, etc.  A device is defined
	as a physical object that would be represented by a single icon if there were a graphical
	view of the studio.

	Devices may have multiple logically distinct sub-components, e.g. a MIDI synthesizer and a
	pair of MIDI ports, both addressable via a USB port. These are called Entities.

	Entities have any number of Endpoints, sources and destinations of 16-channel MIDI streams. 
	By grouping a device's endpoints into entities, the system has enough information for an
	application to make reasonable default assumptions about how to communicate in a
	bi-directional manner with each entity, as is necessary in MIDI librarian applications.

	CoreMIDI attaches a collection of properties to each object it manages. Some properties are
	dynamic characteristics of a device (e.g. MIDI receive channel and system-exclusive ID's),
	and some are a matter of user preference (choice of icon, whether the device should appear
	in lists of possible controllers). Other properties are static and could be looked up in a
	database, using the device's manufacturer and model names as a key.

<h2>Implementation overview</h2>
	The client API is implemented as the CoreMIDI framework, which uses IPC to communicate with
	a server process, MIDIServer.

	The server process loads, and manages all communication with, MIDI drivers.

	"Drivers" are not I/O Kit drivers.  They are bundles containing CFPlugins.

	Many MIDI drivers can simply be user-side I/O Kit clients (probably for serial, USB,
	Firewire).

	PCI card drivers will need their MIDI drivers to communicate with a separate kernel
	extension.

<h2>Note about CoreFoundation data types (CFString, CFData, CFDictionary)</h2>
	When passing a CF object to a MIDI function, the MIDI function will never consume a
	reference to the object; the caller always retains a reference which it is responsible for
	releasing with CFRelease().

	When receiving a CF object as a return value from a MIDI function, the caller always
	receives a new reference to the object, and is responsible for releasing it.

		This specifies the device's current patch, note and control name values using the

		OS-specific constructs outside of the specification, to fully define the current names
		for a device.

		key "master" maps to a CFDataRef containing an AliasHandle referring to the device's

		key "masterDocumentPath" maps to a CFStringRef containing the filesystem path to the device's
		master name document. (This is new as of Mac OS X 10.10, but since the CoreMIDI
		implementation does not parse this dictionary, the convention can be safely ported
		to earlier versions of Mac OS X.)

		key "banks" maps to a CFDictionaryRef.  This dictionary's keys are CFStringRef names of
		patchBank elements in the master document, and its values are each a CFDictionaryRef:
		key "file" maps to a CFDataRef containing an AliasHandle to a document containing
		patches that override those in the master document, and key "patchNameList" maps to a
		CFStringRef which is the name of the patchNameList element in the overriding document.

		key "currentChannelNameSets" maps to a 16-element CFArrayRef, each element of which is a
		CFStringRef of the name of the current mode for each of the 16 MIDI channels.

		key "currentDeviceMode" maps to a CFStringRef containing the name of the device's mode.

		other than the ones they are interested in changing, and to properly structure the
