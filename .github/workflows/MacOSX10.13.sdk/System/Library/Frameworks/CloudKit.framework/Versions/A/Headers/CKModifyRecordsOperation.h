                                               There are two common ways in which a server record will contain keys not present locally:
                                               1 - Since you've fetched this record, another client has added a new key to the record.
                                               2 - The presence of desiredKeys on the fetch / query that returned this record meant
                                               that only a portion of the record's keys were downloaded. */
