.TH CURLINFO_LASTSOCKET 3 "February 03, 2016" "libcurl 7.54.0" "curl_easy_getinfo options"

.SH NAME
CURLINFO_LASTSOCKET \- get the last socket used
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_getinfo(CURL *handle, CURLINFO_LASTSOCKET, long *socket);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Deprecated since 7.45.0. Use \fICURLINFO_ACTIVESOCKET(3)\fP instead.

Pass a pointer to a long to receive the last socket used by this curl
session. If the socket is no longer valid, -1 is returned. When you finish
working with the socket, you must call curl_easy_cleanup() as usual and let
libcurl close the socket and cleanup other resources associated with the
handle. This is typically used in combination with
\fICURLOPT_CONNECT_ONLY(3)\fP.

NOTE: this API is deprecated since it is not working on win64 where the SOCKET
type is 64 bits large while its 'long' is 32 bits. Use the
\fICURLINFO_ACTIVESOCKET(3)\fP instead, if possible.
