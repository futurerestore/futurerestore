.TH CURLINFO_LOCAL_IP 3 "February 03, 2016" "libcurl 7.54.0" "curl_easy_getinfo options"

.SH NAME
CURLINFO_LOCAL_IP \- get local IP address of last connection
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_getinfo(CURL *handle, CURLINFO_LOCAL_IP, char **ip);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a pointer to a char pointer to receive the pointer to a zero-terminated
string holding the IP address of the local end of most recent connection done
with this \fBcurl\fP handle. This string may be IPv6 when that is
enabled. Note that you get a pointer to a memory area that will be re-used at
next request so you need to copy the string if you want to keep the
information.

The \fBip\fP pointer will be NULL or pointing to private memory you MUST NOT
free - it gets freed when you call \fIcurl_easy_cleanup(3)\fP on the
corresponding CURL handle.
