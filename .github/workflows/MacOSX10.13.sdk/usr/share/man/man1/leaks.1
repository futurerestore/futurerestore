.Nm leaks
.Nd Search a process's memory for unreferenced malloc buffers
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm leaks
.Ar pid | partial-executable-name | memory-graph-file
.Op Fl nocontext
.Op Fl nostacks
.Op Fl quiet
.Op Fl exclude Ar symbol
.Op Fl trace Ar address
.Op Fl outputGraph Ar path
.Op Fl fullContent
.Op Fl atExit
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm leaks
identifies leaked memory -- memory that the application has allocated, but has been lost and cannot be freed.
Specifically,
.Nm leaks
examines a specified process's memory for values that may be pointers to malloc-allocated buffers.
Any buffer reachable from a pointer in writable global memory (e.g., __DATA segments), a register, or on the stack is assumed to be memory in use.
Any buffer reachable from a pointer in a reachable malloc-allocated buffer is also assumed to be in use.
The buffers which are not reachable are leaks; the buffers could never be freed because no pointer exists in memory to the buffer, and thus free()
could never be called for these buffers.
Such buffers waste memory; removing
them can reduce swapping and memory usage.
Leaks are particularly dangerous for long-running programs, for eventually the leaks could fill memory and cause the application to crash.
.Pp
.Nm leaks
requires one argument -- either the process ID or the full or partial executable name
of the process to examine, or the pathname of a memory graph file generated by
.Nm leaks
or the Xcode Memory Graph Debugger.
.Pp
For each leaked buffer that is found,
.Nm leaks
prints the address
of the leaked memory and its size.  If 
.Nm leaks
can determine that the
object is an instance of an Objective-C, CoreFoundation, or C++ class,
or a CFType, it also specifies the name and type of the class, and
the binary image that implements the class.
It then prints a string or hexadecimal representation of the contents of the memory,
unless the 
.Fl nocontext
option was specified.
.Pp
If the MallocStackLogging environment variable was set when the
application was launched, 
.Nm leaks
also prints
a stack trace describing where the buffer was allocated.
.Pp
.Sh MEMORY GRAPH FILES
A memory graph file archives the memory state of a process
for further analysis at a later time, on a different machine,
or by other people.  It includes information about all VM and malloc
nodes in the process, and the references between them.
Memory graph files can be generated by
.Nm leaks
using the
.Fl outputGraph
option (and the
.Fl fullContent
option if desired), or by examining a live process with the Xcode Memory Graph Debugger
then using the Export Memory Graph menu item from the File menu.
The standard filename suffix for memory graph files is ".memgraph".
These files can be used as input to various commands including
.Nm leaks,
.Nm heap,
.Nm stringdups,
.Nm vmmap,
.Nm malloc_history,
and the Xcode Memory Graph Debugger.
.Pp
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width "-allSplitLibs"
.It Fl nocontext
Do not print the string or hex representation of leaked memory.
Although that information
can be useful for recognizing the contents of the buffer and understanding
why it might be leaked, it can also provide overwhelming detail,
and could expose confidential information from your process if
you, for example, file bug reports with that output included.
.It Fl nostacks
Do not print backtraces of leaked blocks even if the target process has the
MallocStackLogging environment variable set.
.It Fl quiet
Do not print process description header or binary image list.
.It Fl exclude Ar symbol
Exclude leaked blocks whose backtraces include the specified symbol.  This option
can be repeated for multiple symbols.  This allows ignoring leaks that, for
example, are allocated in libraries for which you do not have source code.
.It Fl trace Ar address
Print chains of references from process 'roots' (e.g., global data, registers,
or locations on stacks) to the given block.  This is useful for determining
what is holding onto a buffer such that it has not been freed.
.It Fl outputGraph Ar path
Generate a memory graph file containing information about all VM and malloc
nodes, and the references between them.
.Ar path
can be a path to a file, or just a directory name; in the latter case
a filename with the ".memgraph" suffix will be generated.
.It Fl fullContent
When generating a memory graph file, include descriptions of the content of various objects,
as would be shown by "heap <pid> -addresses all", and as needed by "stringdups <pid>".
.It Fl atExit
Launches the specified process and runs
.Nm leaks
when the process exits.  The process to launch must be the end of the command, and proceeded by '--':
leaks -atExit -- /MyPath/MyProgram -MyArg
.El
.Pp
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The
.Nm leaks
command may detect more leaks if the target process is run with the MallocScribble environment variable.
If this variable is set then when malloc blocks are deallocated they are filled with 0x55 bytes, thus
overwriting any "stale" data such as pointers remaining in those blocks.  This reduces the number of
false pointers remaining in the process memory.
.Pp
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm leaks
command exits with one of the following values:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width flag -compact
.It Li 0
No leaks were detected.
.It Li 1
One or more leaks were detected.
.It Li \*(Gt1
An error occurred.

.Pp
The Xcode Memory Graph Debuggger graphically shows malloc blocks and VM regions (both leaked and non-leaked),
and the references between them.
.Pp
The Xcode developer tools also include Instruments, a graphical application that can give information similar to that provided by
.Nm leaks.
The Allocations instrument graphically displays dynamic, real-time
information about the object and memory use in an application, including backtraces of where the allocations
occurred.  The Leaks instrument performs memory leak analysis.
