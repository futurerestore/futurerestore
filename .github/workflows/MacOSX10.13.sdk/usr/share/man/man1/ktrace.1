.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
can configure the system to trace events, or record them to a file, and print a
human-readable representation of the events.
.Pp
.Sh SUBCOMMANDS
.Nm
uses a subcommand syntax to separate different functionality into logical
groups.  Each subcommand takes its own set of options, though a few options may
be used in multiple subcommands.
.Bl -tag -width "disable -"
.\" INFO
.It Cm info
Print information about the current configuration of kernel trace.

.\" TRACE
.It Cm trace Oo Fl Nnstu Oc Oo Fl R Ar path | Fl E Oc Oo Fl T Ar timeout Oc Oo Fl c Ar codes-path Op Ar ... Oc Oo Fl f Ar filter-desc Oc Oo Fl x Ar pid-or-name Oo Ar ... Oc | Fl p Ar pid-or-name Oo Ar ... Oc Oc
.Pp
Print events to
.Xr stdout 4
in a human-readable format, automatically providing wall clock time, process
names, and event names for each event.  Without the
.Fl R
or
.Fl E
options,
.Nm
initializes the trace buffers to a reasonable size and enables tracing until it
terminates.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl R Ar path
Print events from the trace file at
.Ar path .
.Pp
.It Fl E
Use an existing configuration, instead of creating a new configuration.  This is
necessary to use the
.Cm trace
subcommand with other
.Nm
subcommands, like
.Cm init
and
.Cm setopt .
.It Fl N
Don't display names of events.
.It Fl n
Display thread names.
.It Fl s
Attempt to symbolicate addresses found in arguments to symbols.
.It Fl t
Print times as Mach absolute timestamps, instead of the default local wall clock
time.
.It Fl u
Attempt to symbolicate addressess to uuid-offset tuples.
.It Fl c Ar codes-path
Use a custom codes file to provide event ID to name mappings.  See
.Xr trace 1
for more details on the format of codes files.
.It Fl f Ar filter-desc
Apply a filter description to the trace session, controlling which events are
traced.  See
.Sx FILTER DESCRIPTIONS
for details on the syntax of a filter.  If no filter description is provided,
all events will be traced.
.It Fl T Ar timeout
End tracing after
.Ar timeout
has elapsed.  Suffixes like
.Li ns
or
.Li ms
are supported, but seconds are the default if just a number is supplied.
.Pp
.It Fl x Ar pid-or-name Oo Ar ... Oc | Fl p Ar pid-or-name Oo Ar ... Oc
Restrict the processes that can trace events.  Either exclude
.Pq Fl x
or only trace events
.Pq Fl p
from the provided processes by name or pid.  These options are mutually
exlusive.  Processes that cannot be attached to are always excluded on release
kernels.  Similarly, events in the Mach scheduling subclass are included,
regardless of the this option, to allow tools to maintain thread scheduling
state machines.
.El
.\" DUMP
.It Cm dump Oo Fl E Oc Oo Fl f Ar filter-desc Oc Oo Fl l Ar compression-level Oc Oo Fl T Ar timeout Oc Oo Ar path Oc
.Pp
Write trace to a file at
.Ar path
for later inspection with
.Nm
.Cm trace Fl R .
If no
.Ar path
is specified, the tool writes to a new, numbered file in the working directory,
starting with
.Li trace001.ktrace .
The command continues to write events until
.Nm
is terminated, the optional timeout triggers, or the trace buffers fill up when
using an existing configuration with wrapping disabled.  If a compression level
is specified, the file is compressed as it is written.  Using non-default
values for this option may increase the overhead of collecting events.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl E
Use an existing configuration, instead of creating a new configuration.
.It Fl f Ar filter-desc
Apply a filter description to events written to the file, controlling which
events are traced.  See
.Sx FILTER DESCRIPTIONS
for details on the syntax of a filter.  If no filter description is provided,
all events will be traced.
.It Fl p
Enable kperf sampling.
.It Fl T Ar timeout
End tracing after
.Ar timeout
has elapsed.  Suffixes like
.Li ns
or
.Li ms
are supported, but seconds are the default if just a number is supplied.
.El
.\" INIT
.It Cm init Fl b Ar buffer-size-mb
.Pp
Initialize trace to allocate
.Ar buffer-size-mb
megabytes of space for its trace buffers.  This subcommand must be provided
before using the
.Cm setopt ,
.Cm enable ,
or
.Cm disable
subcommands initially or after using the
.Cm remove
subcommand.
.Pp
.\" SETOPT
.It Cm setopt Oo Fl f Ar filter-desc Oc Oo Fl w Oc Oo Fl x Ar pid-or-name Oo Ar ... Oc | Fl p Ar pid-or-name Oo Ar ... Oc Oc
.Pp
Set options on the existing trace configuration.  The trace configuration must
already be initialized.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl f Ar filter-desc
Apply a filter description to the current configuration, controlling which
events are traced.  See
.Sx FILTER DESCRIPTIONS
for details on the syntax of a filter.  If no filter description is provided,
all events will be traced.
.Pp
.It Fl w
Configure trace to operate in
.Dq windowed
mode, where the trace buffer acts as a ring buffer, removing old events to make
room for new ones.  By default, tracing ends when the buffer runs out of space
for new events.
.Pp
.It Fl x Ar pid-or-name Oo Ar ... Oc | Fl p Ar pid-or-name Oo Ar ... Oc
Restrict the processes that can trace events.  Either exclude
.Pq Fl x
or only trace events
.Pq Fl p
from the provided processes by name or pid.  These options are mutually
exlusive.  Processes that cannot be attached to are always excluded on release
kernels.  Similarly, events in the Mach scheduling subclass are included,
regardless of the this option, to allow tools to maintain thread scheduling
state machines.
.El
.Pp
.\" ENABLE
.It Cm enable
Start tracing events.
.Pp
.\" DISABLE
.It Cm disable
Stop tracing events.  Tracing can be started again after it has been disabled,
using the same configuration.
.Pp
.It Cm remove
Remove the current trace configuration and free the memory associated with
tracing.
.Pp
.\" EMIT
.It Cm emit Ar debugid Op arg1 Op arg2 Op arg3 Op arg4
.Pp
Emit an event into the trace stream with the provided
.Ar debugid
and arguments.
.\" SYMBOLICATE
.It Nm Cm symbolicate Ar path
Symbolicate the trace file located at
.Ar path .
.\" COMPRESS
.It Nm Cm compress Oo Fl l No fast|balanced|small Oc Ar path
Compress the tsrace file located at
.Ar path
using the small compression level, unless otherwise specified with the
.Fl l
option.
.\" ARTRACE
.It Nm Cm artrace Oo Fl n Oc Oo Fl t Ar timeout Oc Oo Fl i Ar interval Oc Oo Fl o Ar filename Oc Oo Fl b Ar buffer-size-mb Oc Oo Fl f Ar filter-desc Oc
Profile the system and write output to an automatically named file, unless
otherwise specified with the
.Fl o
option.  If the
.Fl t
option is provided, stop tracing and exit after
.Ar timeout
has elapsed.  The timeout value may have
.Li us ,
.Li ms ,
or
.Li s
appended to indicate the time units.  The
.Fl i
option controls the interval that the profiling timer fires.
Set
.Fl n
to disable the profiling timer entirely.
.El
.Sh FILTER DESCRIPTIONS
A filter description is a comma-separated list of class and subclass specifiers
that indicate which events should be traced.  A class specifier starts with
.Ql C
and contains a single byte, specified in either decimal or hex.  A subclass
specifier starts with
.Ql S
and takes two bytes.  The high byte is the class and the low byte is the
subclass of that class.
.Pp
For example, this filter description would enable classes 1 and 37 and the
subclasses 33 and 35 of class 5:
.Ql C1,C0x25,S0x0521,S0x0523 .
The
.Ql ALL
filter description enables events from all classes.
.Sh CAVEATS
Once trace has been initialized with the
.Cm init
subcommand, it remains in use until the space is reclaimed with the
.Cm remove
subcommand.  This prevents background diagnostic tools from making use of trace.
