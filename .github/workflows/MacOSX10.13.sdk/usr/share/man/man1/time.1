finishes,
.Nm
writes the total time elapsed,
the time consumed by system overhead,
and the time used to execute 
.Ar utility 
to the standard error stream.
Times are reported in seconds.
.Pp
Available options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl l
The contents of the
.Em rusage
structure are printed.
.It Fl p
The output is formatted as specified by
.St -p1003.2-92 .

The granularity of seconds on microprocessors is crude and
can result in times being reported for CPU usage which are too large by
a second.
