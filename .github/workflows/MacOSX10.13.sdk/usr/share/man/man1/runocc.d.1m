.TH runocc.d 1m  "Apr 23, 2006" "version 0.50" "USER COMMANDS"
.SH NAME
runocc.d \- run queue occupancy by CPU. Uses DTrace.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B runocc.d
.SH DESCRIPTION
This prints the dispatcher run queue occupancy by CPU each second.
A consistant run queue occupancy is a sign of CPU saturation.

The value is similar to that seen in "sar -q", however this is
calculated in a more accurate manner - sampling at 1000 Hertz.

Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this command.
