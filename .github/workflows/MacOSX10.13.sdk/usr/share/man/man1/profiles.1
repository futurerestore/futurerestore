.Nd Profiles Tool for macOS.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar verb
.Op Ar options
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used to install, remove, list, or otherwise handle various profile types on macOS.
.Pp
Note that the command parameters have changed starting in version 5.0 of this tool, but the older options are still valid and can also be used.  Use the man profiles.old(1) page to view the old parameters.  These older style options will not be updated to provide support for some of the newer profiles tool features, so it's suggested you move to use the new parameter structure.
.Pp
.Sh VERBS
Each command verb is listed with its description and optional individual arguments.   Most commands use the -type option to determine which kind of profile should be used in the command.  For those commands, if no type is specified, the default will be to use the configuration profile type.

.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width indent
.Pp
.It Fl type Ar profile_type
The profile_type can be one of either: "configuration", "provisioning", "startup", or "enrollment" (DEP).  If a command requires a profile type and none is specified, "configuration" will be used.
.It Fl path Ar file_path
A file path or "-" to represent stdout.   When used by the remove command for startup profiles, this should only contain the file name of the profile.
.It Fl user Ar user_name
An OD short user name.   In most cases if no user was specified, then the current user will be used.   If no user option was specified and the process runs as root, the computer/device profiles will be used in the command.
.It Fl uuid Ar profile_uuid
A canonical form UUID to specify a profile's PayloadUUID, such as 5A15247B-899C-474D-B1D7-DBD82BDE5684.   Only used by the remove provisioning profile command.
.It Fl identifier Ar profile_identifier
A profile identifier (PayloadIdentifier) to specify a profile.
.It Fl output Ar output_path
The output path location .   The output_path argument must be specified to use this option, Use 'stdout' to send this informaton to the console.  File output will be written as an XML plist file, or you can use 'stdout-xml' to write XML to the console.  The toplevel key of the dictionary will contain either the user name, or _computerLevel for device or provisioning profile information.
.It Fl enrolledUser Ar enrollment_user_name
The user name specified when installing an enrollment profile.
.It Fl password Ar password
An optional password used when removing a configuration profile which requires the password removal option.
.It Fl forced
For startup profiles, this option will force a retry to occur at every boot until the profile is successfully installed.   For other profiles, this will prevent confirmation requests, and when trying to remove all configuration profles for a user, it will ignore any errors during removal.
.It Fl all
For configuration profiles, when running as root, the use of this option with the list or show commands will display all profiles installed on the system.   When removing profiles, using this option will remove all profiles for that user (or device).
