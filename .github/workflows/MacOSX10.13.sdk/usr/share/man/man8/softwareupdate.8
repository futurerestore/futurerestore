followed by zero or more
.Ar args .
.Pp
.Nm
requires admin authentication for all commands except

as root and avoid all further authentication prompts.
.Pp
The following
.Ar commands
are available:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl l | -list
List all available updates.
.It Fl i | -install
Each update specified by
.Ar args
is downloaded and installed.
.Ar args
can be one of the following:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Ar -r | --recommended
All updates that are recommended for your system. These are prefixed with a
.Em *
character in the
.Cm --list
output.
.It Ar -a | --all
All updates that are applicable to your system, including those non-recommended ones,
which are prefixed with a 
.Em -
character in the

One or more specified updates. The 
.Cm --list
output shows the item names you can specify here, prefixed by the

.It Fl d | -download
Each update specified by
.Ar args
is downloaded but not installed. The values of

are the same as for the

command. Updates downloaded with

can be subsequently installed with
.Cm --install ,
or through the App Store (as long as they remain applicable to your system).
Updates are downloaded to

but are not designed to be installed by double-clicking the packages in that
directory: always use
.Cm --install
or the App Store to actually perform the install.

is the first part of the item name (before the dash and version number) that is shown by
.Cm --list .

.It Fl -schedule Ar on | off
